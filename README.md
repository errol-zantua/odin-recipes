# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project under the Foundations course. 

This project will test and check HTML basics (so far) that was taught in the course. 

Students are asked to create a website that shows information on some recipes. This will test and check the student's knowledge about creating HTML pages from scratch linking several web pages, adding images, showing lists and other basic HTML tags.
